Team 75 - Chess Game


DESCRIPTION

This project consists in a simple Player vs Player Java Chess application, using JavaFX for the GUI. It implements all the
basic rules of Chess, and shows the user all the possible moves for any of the pieces. It keeps a history of the game's state,
allowing users to undo their actions. The game is over once a king is in check and there are no possible moves that will allow
it to exit this state. There is no time limit for players to make a move.

WORK BREAKDOWN

- Viorel Rotaru was responsible for writing the game engine. This includes coding most game classes and logic related to how
pieces move and interact with the board and between each other. An example of this is how the pieces get their possible moves
and how the check and castling logic is implemented.

- Andres Mechali designed and implemented the GUI using JavaFX, which handles the user input and the logic for interacting
with the game. This includes the different buttons on all the game screens, the selection of pieces and the visualization of
the game's state, among other things.

- Both of us collaborated in the first design on the structure and logic of the whole application, and on the final
integration of the UI with the game engine. We also designed the tests and collaborated with each other reviewing every commit
before merging it to the master branch.
